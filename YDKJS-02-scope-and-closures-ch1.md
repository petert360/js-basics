# Chapter 1: What is Scope?

## [Compiler terminology](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/scope%20%26%20closures/ch1.md#compiler-speak)

### Look-up types
* LHS:  left-hand side of an assignment operator, meaning: "[who's the TARGET of the assignment][1]".  
LHS look-up can be phrased as a [CONTAINER look-up][2]
* RHS:  right-hand side of an assignment operator, meaning "[who's the SOURCE of the assignment][1]".  
RHS look-up can be phrased as a [VALUE look-up][2]
